/**
 * Source ports: read-only views of the systems Radar ingests from. Adapters
 * (Jira, GitHub, Google Calendar, Flocktools, demo fakes) return validated
 * domain records; they never write back to the source.
 *
 * Contract for every adapter:
 * - Failures reject with `SourceUnavailableError` carrying a short, safe
 *   reason (no URLs, tokens, or upstream bodies). The sync use case stores
 *   only that reason and keeps going with the other sources.
 * - Timestamps are normalized to UTC ISO strings via `Date#toISOString()`
 *   (Jira's `2026-10-08T10:00:00.000+0000` becomes `...000Z`), so string
 *   comparison and `Date.parse` agree everywhere downstream.
 * - Natural keys are unique within one response; the sync use case still
 *   dedupes defensively (last occurrence wins).
