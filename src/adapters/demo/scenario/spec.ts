/**
 * Declarative description of one demo project. `builder.ts` turns a spec into
 * domain records anchored to "today"; `projects.ts` holds the three specs.
 *
 * Day numbers refer to working days of the ACTIVE sprint: day 1 is its first
 * working day and "today" is always day 6, so days 1-5 are in the past and
 * days 6-10 are the remaining ones. Days above 10 continue into the next
 * sprint (useful for future PTO).
