-- 0002_rls.sql — Row Level Security and least-privilege grants.
--
-- Model:
-- - Users read the projects they are members of (project_members), and every
--   project-scoped row of those projects, sync runs included.
-- - LLM usage (llm_calls) is readable only by admins: users whose JWT carries
--   app_metadata.role = 'admin' (app_metadata is writable only server-side).
-- - All writes go through the service role (sync, forecasts, AI layer), which
--   bypasses RLS. The only user writes: owners and leads change an alert's
--   status (column privilege + policy + transition trigger) and create
--   reports as themselves (column privileges + policy).
-- - anon has no privileges at all; authenticated has SELECT plus the two
--   column-level grants above.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Helpers (security definer: they read project_members and the JWT without
-- recursing into RLS; empty search_path, fully qualified names)
